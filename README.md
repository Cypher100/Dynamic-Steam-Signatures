## Dynamic-Steam-Signatures

PHP Based application that can generate steam signatures from the gaming platform steam in a PNG format. The application is very portable, and can run on shared web hosting.

The application is fully functional, but still would require some possible tune up, and tweaking. Any help would be appreciated.
